        this week. The gym clothes. A poorly functioning school platform
        who eats time and energy? There is no room for that. So we have
        built a better one. With all the information you need as a parent.
        Faster and above all - much less hassle.`,

        Is it possible to make the app free and still support our efforts
        through Patreon? We'll see... Until April 29:th, the app is free
        on both iOS and Android. After that we have to decide if it was a
        good idea or not. So tip yor friends! And please support us on Patreon ‚ù§Ô∏è`,
