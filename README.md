## Embedded API

We previously were testing having a proxy for the API. That was a bad idea, even if we weren't saving any information on our side it still was an extra complexity so we encapsulated our API into its own npm package so the app still could be lightweight and not have to worry about the complex nature of the official API.

Read about the embedded api here: https://github.com/kolplattformen/api-hooks

## App

The central part of the project is of course the app. It is written in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and is using a UI library called React Native Kitten. Our goal with the app is to make it as fast and easy to use as possible. We start small and will continue to add more features over time.

_PRO TIP_ Login with personal number 12121212121212, 201212121212 or 1212121212 and the api will be put into fake mode. Static data will be returned and no calls to backend will be made.

## Website

Our official site for the project is [https://skolplattformen.org](https://skolplattformen.org). The source code for the site lives here [packages/site](packages/site)

## Development

### Get started

Run the following command to install JavaScript dependencies (using `yarn`) in
all the packages. After that you can refer to the specific package's README to
find out how to get it running.

```
npx lerna bootstrap
```

## Contributions

We want this project to become a citizen movement. Every time you find something you want to fix, we encourage you to try to fix the problem yourself by providing a "pull request" - meaning you fix the problem yourself, test it out on your machine and then send the fix to us with documentation about why we should incorporate your fix into our main branch. This way we can continue to improve the project together with our users which hopefully will render in a much better experience and fast moving project.

If you don't know how to program and still want to contribute we encourage you to file an Issue or help us an any other way. Please find the Issues tab above to see other issues or file one yourselves. We are super duper happy for both issues and PR:s and will try to answer all of them as soon as humanly possible.

## Money

We are both an open source project and still charge money for our app. Isn't this contradicting? No. Open doesn't mean free. We want to be able to sustainably continue to work with maintaining this project which means someone needs to pay for the köttbullar to the kids. Our goal is to be able to reimburse all contributions to the project.

## Disclaimer

This initiative is started by frustrated parents and we have no affiliation with Stockholm Stad. We just want to find and read our newsletters a little bit easier and register sick-leave more convenient.

If you are offended by this initiative, please don't - we come in peas.
